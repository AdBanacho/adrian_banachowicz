## First Exercise
    Write a function that detects all duplicate elements...

I propose two solutions for this task.
My first solution is written in SQL; however, since a query is not a function, I have also prepared a static method in Python for this task.
### SQL Solution

The query is designed for MS SQL.

Instructions to Run (Free SQL IDE https://sqliteonline.com/):

1. Create a table.
2. Insert data.
3. Add additional test cases (if needed).
4. Execute the select query.

_This approach was slightly different and provided an interesting
way for me to solve the task. However, it is not perfect due to
the use of a self-join and the requirement for an additional
position column. Additionally, in this approach, 
the object could be a string of up to 255 characters._
